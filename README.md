#Escape the Matrix!

###The Problem

You and your team mates have been trapped in the world of Javascript! All of you are now Javascript Objects!

###Your Mission

Create a object which contains the following properties:
 + **teamCaptainName**
  - Value set as a string
 + **teamMember1**
  - Value set as a string
 + **teamMember2**
  - Value set as a string

Within the same object, create the following method:
 + **escape()**
  - This function will return a string that says all team members have escaped

_Note: You will be working in JSBIN for this TFR_

###What we want to see

The method `escape()` being stored in a variable `weHaveEscaped` and printed out with `console.log` to show that every team member has escaped!
